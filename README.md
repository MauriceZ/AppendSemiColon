# AppendSemiColon
Sublime package to append semi colons at the end of a line.

Place a semicolon at the end of the cursor's current line(s) by pressing:
+ <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> on OS X
+ <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> on Windows and Linux

This is especially useful in situations like these:

You can also automatically go to the next line at the same time like this:

![more cool stuff](http://i.imgur.com/66mhs6h.gif)

with these shorcuts:
+ <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> on OS X
+ <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> on Windows and Linux

## Other Features
+ If a line already ends with a semicolon, no semicolon will be added
+ When appending a semicolon to a line ending in a comment, the semicolon will be placed before the comment
